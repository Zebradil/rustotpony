CLI manager of [time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) generators.
It is a desktop alternative to Google Authenticator.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Packages, available in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/):

- [rustotpony](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rustotpony/)
- [rustotpony-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rustotpony-bin/)

### Other

Grab an appropriate binary from [the latest release](https://github.com/Zebradil/rustotpony/releases/latest) and put it
in a place of your choice. If you're on the \*nix system, don't forget to set proper permissions: `chmod +x totp`.

### Build manually

#### From crates.io

Make sure you have `$HOME/.cargo/bin` in your `$PATH`.

```shell
cargo install rustotpony
```

#### From source

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `cargo install` from the inside of the repo directory
1. Keep calm and wait for the compilation

Probably, you will need `gcc` (Linux) or `clang` (Mac OS) to compile dependencies.

### Choose your password wisely

On the first run, `totp` will prompt you to create a password for a new database, which is stored at `$HOME/.rustotpony/totp.safe`.
This database is encrypted using the password you provide with age-encryption.

If you forget the password or wish to change it, you will need to delete the database file.
While this process is currently a bit inconvenient,
I'm working on improving usability and will be adding a command to facilitate password changes in the future.

### Basic scenario

1. Retrieve a secret key from your TOTP provider (it must be encoded with base32, for example, `GEZDGMZSGE2TKCQ=`)

   ```shell
   $ # Creating a fake secret key for demo purposes
   $ echo 123321555 | base32
   GEZDGMZSGE2TKNIK
   ```

1. Add new generator with `totp add <NAME>` (you will be asked for a secret and a password)

   ```shell
   $ # Adding a new TOTP generator
   $ totp add demo
   Enter your secret code:
   Enter your database pass:
   New application created: demo
   ```

1. Use `totp list` to check your secrets

   ```shell
   $ # Listing all secrets in the database
   $ totp list
   Enter your database pass:
   +------+------------------+----------+
   | name | key              | username |
   +------+------------------+----------+
   | demo | GEZDGMZSGE2TKNIK |          |
   +------+------------------+----------+
   ```

1. Use `totp dash` or just `totp` for real-time dashboard

   ```shell
   $ # Display real-time dashboard with all generators
   $ totp
   Enter your database pass:
   Welcome to RusTOTPony realtime dashboard! Press ^C to quit.
   [=============================================               ]
   009216 demo
   ```

1. After hitting ^C it'll clean up the dashboard

   ```shell
   $ totp
   Enter your database pass:
   I won't tell anyone about this ü§´
   ```
