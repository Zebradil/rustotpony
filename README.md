CLI manager of [time-based one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) generators.
It is a desktop alternative for Google Authenticator.

## Installation

Grab an appropriate binary from [the latest release](https://github.com/Zebradil/rustotpony/releases/latest).

### Build manually

#### From crates.io

Make sure you have `$HOME/.cargo/bin` in your `$PATH`.

```sh
$ cargo install rustotpony
```

#### From source

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `cargo install` from the inside of the repo directory
1. Keep calm and wait for compilation

Probably, you will need `gcc` (Linux) or `clang` (Mac OS) to compile dependencies.

### Choose your password wisely

At the very first run `totp` asks for a password for a new database. It's located at `$HOME/.rustotpony/db.json` (don't be confused by `json` extension, actually, it's a binary file). If you forget the password or want to change it, you have to remove `$HOME/.rustotpony` directory. It's not convenient, but I'm going to improve usablity and an option for changing password.

### Basic scenario

1. Retrieve a secret key from your TOTP provider (it must be encoded with base32, for example: `GEZDGMZSGE2TKCQ=`)
    ```sh
    $ # Creating a fake secret key for demo purposes
    $ echo 123321555 | base32
    GEZDGMZSGE2TKNIK
    ```
    
1. Add new generator with `totp add <NAME>` (you will be asked for a secret and a password)
    ```sh
    $ # Adding a new TOTP generator
    $ totp add demo
    Enter your secret code: 
    Enter your database pass: 
    New application created: demo
    ```
    If it's not the first run, you'll be asked for password twice: for opening database and for saving it.

1. Use `totp list` to check your secrets
    ```sh
    $ # Listing all secrets in the database
    $ totp list
    Enter your database pass: 
    +------+------------------+----------+
    | name | key              | username |
    +------+------------------+----------+
    | demo | GEZDGMZSGE2TKNIK |          |
    +------+------------------+----------+
    ```
1. Use `totp dash` or just `totp` for realtime dashboard
    ```sh
    $ # Display real-time dashboard with all generators
    $ totp
    Enter your database pass: 
    Welcome to RusTOTPony realtime dashboard! Press ^C to quit.
    [=============================================               ]
    009216 demo
    ```
1. After hitting ^C it'll cleanup the dashboard
    ```sh
    $ totp
    Enter your database pass: 
    I won't tell anyone about this ü§´
    ```

## TODO

- command completion
- database password caching
- tests
- refactor `show` and `show-all` commands
